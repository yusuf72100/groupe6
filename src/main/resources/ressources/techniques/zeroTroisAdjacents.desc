In this example there is an X above the 3, so there is only one way to loop around the 3: on the left, on the bottom and on the right as shown below. We can now extend the loop with two additional lines, one to the right and one to the left, because there is only one way to continue in each direction. And finally, we can mark four Xâ€™s next to the corners because having lines in these places will create branches (or crossings), which are not allowed according to Slitherlink rules.
